              <p>Small and big companies from around the region participate in DevFest.Asia to get exposure for their developer focussed product, to share job opportunities and find talent or simply to gain exposure for their company or brand.</p> 
              <p>With more than 1200 web developers attending 17 events last year we intend to increase reach and vibrancy this year even further and make it an unforgettable experience for attendees as well as a stepping stone into the local developer scene and the entrepreneurial and enterprise ecosystems. Singapore holds a great developer community and we need amazing companies to be part of it!
